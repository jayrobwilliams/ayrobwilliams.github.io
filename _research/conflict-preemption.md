This research focus on leveraging social media data (i.e. Twitter) to comprehensively assess public dynamic situational awareness during 2020 wildfire season at the city-level. In this study, I employed Bidirection-al Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) topic modeling to cluster Twitter data and conducted a temporal-spatial analysis to understand topic distribution across various regions. Additionally, I integrated the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model to quantitatively measure the extent and speed of topic diffusion, facilitating more precise resource allocation. The results of the temporal-spatial analysis highlighted a close alignment between topic diffusion and wildfire locations and timelines, showcasing the real-time nature of Twitter discussions in response to unfolding events. Moreover, the findings from the topic-based SIR model revealed that the pace of topic diffusion corresponded with wildfire propagation patterns, reflecting varying levels of public awareness and responses. Furthermore, the study underscored the diversity of concerns expressed by different communities, emphasizing the need to tailor disaster responses to meet local needs effectively.

> There are many regions that meet the necessary conditions for sovereign governance in the world, but few secessionist conflicts. I argue that this relative paucity of secessionist violence is the result of government preemption of potential secessionist movements. Using cross-national geospatial data from 1992 to 2013, I find that governments invest more, measured via nighttime light emissions, in more secession-prone regions. The same factors that make territory attractive for secession, such as large populations and international borders, also make governments willing to work to retain control of that territory, contributing to the scarcity of separatist civil conflicts.
