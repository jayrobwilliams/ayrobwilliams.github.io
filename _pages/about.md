Greeting! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the deparment of civil and environmental engineering (CEE) at the University of Maryland (UMD), currently conducting reserach as part of [Dr.Baecher's](https://cee.umd.edu/clark/faculty/244/Gregory-B-Baecher) esteemed reserach group. I am also a research collaborator with the 
[Risk-Informed Solutions in Engineering Laboratory](https://riselab.umd.edu/). I received an M.S.in civil engineering in project management from UMD in 2020 and M.S.in civil engineering in structure engineering from San Franciso State University (SFSU) in 2018. 

My academic work has been published or is forthcoming in esteemed journals such as the *International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction*, the *Journal of Biomedical Informatics*, the *Journal of Construction Engineering and Management*, the *Fire Safety Journal*, and the J*ournal of Air Transport Management*, among others. These [research](reserach) endeavors focus on harnessing crowdsourced information to enhance informed decision-making in emergency management. My overarching aim is to contribute to the establishment of resilient and sustainable communities.
