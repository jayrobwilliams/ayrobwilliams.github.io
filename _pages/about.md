Greeting! I am a Ph.D. candidate in the deparment of civil and environmental engineering (CEE) at the University of Maryland (UMD), currently conducting reserach as part of [Dr.Baecher's](https://cee.umd.edu/clark/faculty/244/Gregory-B-Baecher) esteemed reserach group. I am also a research collaborator with the 
[Risk-Informed Solutions in Engineering Laboratory](https://riselab.umd.edu/). I received an M.S.in civil engineering in project management from UMD in 2020 and M.S.in civil engineering in structure engineering from San Franciso State University (SFSU) in 2018. 

My academic work has been published or is forthcoming in International Journal of Disaster Risk Reduction,Journal of Biomedical Informatics, Journal of Construction Engineering and Management,Fire Safety Journal and Journal of Air Transport Management, among other outlets. These reseraches harnessing the crowdsouring information to emphasis the informed decition-making during emergency management, with the goal to build reliability and sustaibility communities.
